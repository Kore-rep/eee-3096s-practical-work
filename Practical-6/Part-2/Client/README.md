This is a repo for the python client required. It is hosted on a Raspberry Pi 0W using Balena for deployment.
It sends light and temperature readings to a server with a hardcoded IP address, also hosted on Balena.
The client can accept various commands from the server, and auto reconnects when it loses contact with the server.
